## Our Data Story

With ten-thousands of active items on auction every day, hundred-thousands of bids, millions of users, and billions of events, the Catawiki platform generates vast amounts of data. We collect this data centrally, using it to generate business insights, as well as powering machine learning models that enhance our user experience, optimize our workflows, and keep our platform safe.

We believe in creating flexible models that can be applied to a variety of use cases, and in experimentation and iteration to hit the ground running and continually improve the tools we build.

The Data Team, which covers the full data spectrum of Machine Learning, Analysis and Data Engineering, has a clear a mission within Catawiki:

### Data Scientist

Take up a key role in our Data Science team where your work has direct and meaningful impact. Be at the core of our data-driven business, building predictive and innovative models shaping our marketing and customer strategy, and driving our growth. And every day at work, you'll be doing your part for all the charities we support.

What you’ll do:
- You'll apply your skills in predictive modeling and advanced statistical techniques (like regression and classification techniques, forecasting, A/B testing and causal inference), to deeply understand and predict customer behavior, helping us make smarter decisions about retention and value.
- You will take ownership of your models from end-to-end: from data exploration in Snowflake and feature engineering to deploying your models on AWS SageMaker.
- Be responsible for making sure your work is automated, tested, and reliable. You will work closely with GitLab.
- You’ll be the one translating fuzzy business questions into concrete data science problems and translating your complex results back into clear, actionable insights for your stakeholders.
- You’ll work closely with our Machine Learning Engineering and Platform team to continuously improve our shared tools, ML platform and best practices.

You’d describe yourself as follows:
- At least 4-6 years of experience as a Data Scientist, with a proven track record of taking models from an idea to a live, production system.
- Strong foundation in statistical and machine learning techniques, especially predictive modeling, regression and classification techniques, and understanding causal impact and A/B testing.
- Fluent in Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels etc.) and write strong, clean SQL (we use Snowflake).
- Comfortable with concepts like containerizing models with Docker and CI/CD, and have hands-on experience with GitLab/AWS SageMaker.
